<h2>My Top 5 Movies of All Time.</h2>

<hr />


<h3>The Joker (2019)</h3>
<p>The deeper meaning behind Joker and the role society plays in ones mental health is at the forefront in this movie.</p>

<h3>The Batman (2022)</h3>
<p>This was batman on the screen like we have never seen him before. Understanding that his purpose was bigger than himself.</p>

<h3>The Wedding Ringer (2015)</h3>
<p>Kevin Hart's funniest movie in my humble opinion.</p>

<h3>Forrest Gump (1994)</h3>
<p>Resilience and Sympathy were the words that came to my mind. A man who just wants to reunite with his childhood sweetheart.</p>

<h3>Life (1999)</h3>
<p>To be black men in America once upon a now. Eddie Murphy and Martin Lawrence applied a light hearted spin on it.</p>
